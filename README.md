## Technologies Involved
### Flutter

Flutter was the framework used for implementing the client side of the software, the decision to use flutter was based on the fact of the fast-paced nature of development on this framework and the ability of using the same codebase for development on the android, web or any other platform.



### ASP.NET Core

ASP.NET Core is architected for testability and integrates seamlesslywith popular client-side frameworks, thus a preferred framework for developing the robust backend of this project.

## Features of Future

This project is a means for growth, thus it will grow itself, the following is the list of features and the roadmap in my mind:
